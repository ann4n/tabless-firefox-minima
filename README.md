# Minima
*Minimalist Firefox Theme inspired by qutebrowser*
![Screenshot](screenshot_tabs.png)
## What this does
Gives Firefox a minimalist appearance and only shows the url bar when it's focused (<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>). Also, the tab bar is completely hidden when only one tab is opened, leaving the entire window for the website. 
## Installation
1. Create a folder with the name `chrome` in your Firefox profile directory and copy the `userChrome.css` into it. To find your profile directory, go to about:support or about:profiles.
2. Go to about:config and set `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to `true`
3. Restart Firefox.
